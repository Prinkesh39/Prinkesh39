👋 👀  🌱 Hi I'm Prinkesh currently working as a Senior Manager in one of the premier banks in India. 
Recently I have developed some interest in Machine Learning and the effect of Data in all walks of life. So I started learning more about it and what 
better way to learn is to actually try doing some machine learning model myself. 

 💞️ It will be my pleasure if i would be able to collaborate with someone who is also passionate about the data. I'm in learning stage right now, so working
with some one experienced enough will help me in a long way.

In future, however if given an opportunity, would definetly like to work with some company who primarily focus on preactical implementation of machine learning models 
on the data.
